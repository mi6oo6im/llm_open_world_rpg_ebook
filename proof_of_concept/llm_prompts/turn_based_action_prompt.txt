### INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAME MASTER
1. VALIDATE: Check if the action is possible given the player's 'inventory' and 'attributes' and nearby objects. 
2. NARRATE: Write the outcome of the action in second-person ("You..."). Maintain the current 'weather' and 'time_phase'.
3. NPC INTERACTION: If an NPC is present, include their reaction or dialogue following their 'voice_style' and 'trust_score'.
4. DYNAMICS: If the player attempts something difficult, consult the 'ActionValidator' logic—success is not guaranteed.
